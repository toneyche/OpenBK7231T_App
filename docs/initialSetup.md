# Initial setup
First flash your devices with our binary from [Releases tab](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/releases), then follow steps from [FLASHING.md](https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App/blob/main/FLASHING.md) or watch our [flashing tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6d42IMGhHw). An open access point should appear after flashing. Connect to it, open page at 192.168.4.1 (or on BL602 it may be 192.168.169.1), go to Config->WiFi, enter your WiFi SSID/pass, reboot, and finally check your DHCP page for new device IP. You can use MAC reservation to keep constant IP. Next you need to setup the pins of the device (GPIO roles), you can figure them out yourself, use a [device template](https://openbekeniot.github.io/webapp/devicesList.html) (device template can be applied in Web Application, click Open Web Application button), or [ask on our forum](https://www.elektroda.com/rtvforum/forum390.html). Then you can configure your MQTT, use HASS Discovery, etc.
