# HomeAssistant Integration
MQTT based integration with Home Assistant is possible in 2 ways from the Home Assistant configuration page (`Config > Generate Home Assistant cfg`).

 You can paste the generated [yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/yaml/) configuration into Home Assistant configuration manually. You can also improve this YAML, edit it however you like, because for some advanced devices the autogenerated config might be empty

Or add the devices automatically via discovery (see [YT tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkcspey25V4). To do click the `Start Home Assistant Discovery` button which sends outs [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/) messages, one for each entity (switch, light).
* The discovery topic should match the `discovery_prefix` defined in Home Assistant, the default value is `homeassistant`.
* More details about Home Assistant discovery can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/).
 Note: Currently, discovery is implemented for lights, relays, and simple sensor entities.
